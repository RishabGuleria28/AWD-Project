        <p><b class="A">A</b>lthough depression can make you feel alone, you are not alone. Depression, often known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is one of the most common mental illnesses, affecting an estimated 350 million individuals of all ages. It's important to understand that depression is not the same as sadness. It's natural to feel down or unmotivated on sometimes, but depression is more persistent. It also has a biological foundation.</p>

        <p>Mental health issues have affected every person in our country, yet each person's experience is unique. Our support, which is based on the Scottish Government's Mental Health Strategy, is aimed at assisting people in living freely and well within their communities.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="about-you">WE OFFER</p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>Supports that are both community-based and recovery-oriented. Our assistance always begins with a co-creation of a personalised support plan that reflects each person's unique needs, current situation, and intended personal outcomes. However, because people's outcomes change and their support requirements change, we react, adapt, and adjust as people's lives change.
        <br><br>Whilst each person’s support is unique, there are common themes around which people seek support to improve their health, wellbeing and participation in life, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximising independence in the home, including tenancy agreements, finances and personal care</li>
            <li>Building and maintaining relationships with family, friends and other networks</li>
            <li>Managing medication and treatment programmes</li>
            <li>Shopping and cooking healthy meals on a budget</li>
            <li>Enjoying education, employment or volunteering</li>
            <li>Attending social activities, connecting with local resources and trying new things</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="spcl-txt">
        <p>We promote and focus on recovery, rehabilitation and personal growth: maximising independence, developing and building skills, and creating a robust circle of support.  Many people want to avoid being admitted to hospital and so we work together to develop agreed approaches to stay safe and well at home.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="about-you">We achieve this by...</p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>Identifying goals with each person and adopting a “do with” method, rather than “do for”.  We are tenacious and do not give up on people. 
        <br><br>
        Our specially trained practitioners develop strong support relationships, break down barriers and positively persist with people to ensure they are informed, engaged and active citizens in their home and community.
